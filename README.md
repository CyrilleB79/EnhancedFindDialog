## Features

### Search history
In many web sites and web applications, the fastest way to access specific places is by using the search command, often bound to ctrl + nvda + f keys.

The search dialog allows us to type a text and be placed on the next occurrence of that text if it exists.

In many cases, you will find yourself visiting the same web sites several times during the same NVDA session. In many of these web sites you will need to search for the same terms, specially if this is the only way to get quickly to a link or section of that web site.

This is specially the case of people who work on a daily basis with web based systems as part of their jobs.

However, NVDA does not keep the previous terms you searched on a list. This slows down your productivity, because unless you are searching for the exact same term of your last search, you have to type it again.

This addon keeps a search history that lasts as long as NVDA is running. So, on activation, you just need to press down arrow and choose previously searched terms to perform a new search.

You can of course type new terms. They will also be added to the list next time you activate the search dialog.

#### How it works?

Simply install the addon. When it is activated, pressing down and up arrows on the edit field on the search dialog will let you navigate through the list of previously searched terms.

You can at any time type a new term as usual.
